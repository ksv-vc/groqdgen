# POC: groqdgen

**Hint:** This is only a POC, and should not be used for generating production-use `groqd` queries.

## Usage

To check the usage, check our the `lib/parser.ts` file, and see what it does.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement basic functionality
- [ ] Add advanced functionality like conditional selection
- [ ] Add schema matching (supply a schema, and match the groqd schema, so that the query is not giving us `q.unknown()`
